# SumatraWhitepaper

**Sumatra** is a collection of projects with a wide range of applications. It exists as a **modular**, **extendable**, **minimalistic**, **secure** approach to a system that allows users/clients to do many tasks not usually able to be accomplished by today's systems, in a manner that can not be done easily by other systems. It was originally created by `silene` on `2 July, 2024`. It uses advanced cryptography, networking, decentralization, and blockchain-related technology known as Block Lattices. It also emplys smart contracts (through its VM and type system), rules, and pivot points. It interlopes with other technology such as BTC, ETH, SOL, Filecoin, and IPFS.

## Notice:

This information is not complete. We are also looking for programmers to contribute to open-source development of this project.

## List of Projects

### SumatraPivotSystem

The **SumatraPivotSystem** exists as a version of sumatra to allow **modularity/extendability** over-time. It exists in two layers, one, the base pivot point, and the other being on top to allow easy extendability over-time.

### SumatraLattice

A DAG that exists to verify certain information existing from a pivot. Different versions of the block lattices are developed.

### Sumatra

### Relay System

There exists a multitude of different relays with different properties in sumatra. These relays are decentralized and each relay can choose which information to relay.

#### Initial-Relay (Init-Relay `relay0x000`)

An **initial-relay** is the relay that allows you onto the network.

## Binaries

### sumatradigest

A digest system for creating digests using common hash functions.

### sumatracrypt

An encryption system using different.

### sumatrasig

A digital signature scheme.

### sumatrapq

A collection of Post-Quantum Cryptography.

## Types of Technologies Used:

- Homomorphic Encryption
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Hash Functions
- Digital Signatures
- Public-Key Cryptography
- VRF
